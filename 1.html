<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FilmTrailerZone" target="_blank" title="Film trailers">Film</a>, also called movie or motion picture, is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere, by the means of recorded or programmed[vague] moving images, along with sound (and more rarely) other sensory stimulations. The word <strong><u>"cinema"</u></strong>, short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.

</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.</p>
